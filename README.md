## ATYWT

_About Time You Wrote Tests_

Generates Test files from `/src`. Currently supports React, Jest, and React Testing Library.

**Repository Consistency is key for this to work**

### Road Map

- [x] Create functionality to read file and return properties
- [x] Create functionality to recursively read directories and return files to be tested
- [ ] Create functionality to write file
- [ ] Write Tests because this is a testing scaffolding tool
- [ ] Create a config reader
- [ ] Write support code for non baralled repos
- [ ] Write code for non tsx support
- [ ] Write code for Vue Support
- [ ] Create the ability to overwrite existing test files
